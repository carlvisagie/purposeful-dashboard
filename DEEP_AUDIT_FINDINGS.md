## PHASE 1: COPY, MESSAGING & PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS

### CorporateLanding Copy Analysis

**ISSUE #1: Hero Copy Lacks Specificity**
- Current: "Reduce Healthcare Costs by 20% Through Emotional Resilience"

**ISSUE #2: Missing PAS Framework (Problem → Agitation → Solution)**

- Current messaging sounds generic, not authoritative
- Fix needed: "Expert-led human coaching" or "Certified emotional resilience coaches"
